# First FrontEnd practice

In this first practices we are ment to do a space invaders using HTML5, CSS3 and JS with the library DOM.

To do so I create different carpets and files:

- audio: With the sounds of the game and the spacecraft shots sound
- css: With the css file included in the head of the HTML5 document
- html: With the HTML5 document to be executed
- img: With the different images and icons I used for the game
- js: With the JS file which will control the whole game

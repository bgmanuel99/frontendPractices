## About this project

This is the final exam of the web interface programming subject.

If there is any problem while running i remember which packages i'm using and you will have to install(only if necesary):

- Apollo client, you can install it with --> npm install @apollo/client graphql
- React spinners, you can install them with --> npm install --save react-spinners
- Axios, it should appear cause i installed it globally, but better save than sorry, so if there is any problem you can install it with --> npm install -s axios

* Remember that this web is not responsive, so if there is any problem with the css is because you are using the page in a computer with a higher o lower resolution.

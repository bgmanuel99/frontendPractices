## About this project

This is the final exam of the web interface programming subject.

- You will have to install all the dependencies with the command -> npm install -s
- If there is any problem with the downloads you will have to run the command -> npm audit fix
- After that you can run the program with the command -> npm start

If there is any other problem with the downloads in the package.json, i remember which packages i'm using and you will have to install if they were not downloaded with the other dependencies:

- Apollo client, you can install it with --> npm install @apollo/client graphql
- React spinners, you can install them with --> npm install --save react-spinners
- Axios, it should appear cause i installed it globally, but better save than sorry, so if there is any problem you can install it with --> npm install -s axios

#### Remember also that this web is not responsive, so if there is any problem with the css is because you are using the page in a computer with a higher o lower resolution.
